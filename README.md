# Hydrogen-like-Atom
his code I got from my lecturer in Computational Atom to observe the wave function of Hydrogen-like atom. I modified the code to compare the probability function of numerical and analytical result. in the other file I modified the analytical wave function. Exactly, I don't know who the author of the program. If you know or find similar code please inform me to praise the author.
